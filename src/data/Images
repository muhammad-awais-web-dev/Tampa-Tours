1. The Levitating Archipelago (/assets/spots/archipelago.jpg)
Prompt: A wide landscape photograph of the Levitating Archipelago on the planet Tampa. A chain of massive, jungle-covered rock islands floats suspended hundreds of meters above a turquoise ocean. Waterfalls cascade from the edges of the floating islands, turning into mist before reaching the sea below due to low gravity. The binary suns, one golden and one orange, are in the sky, casting a warm light. The style is epic, vibrant, and gravity-defying.

2. Vellaris Prime (/assets/spots/city.jpg)
Prompt: A twilight view of Vellaris Prime, an alien city woven entirely into the high canopy of gigantic, skyscraper-tall trees. The structures are made of living, bioluminescent vines and flora that glow with soft blue, purple, and green light. Suspended walkways and organic bridges connect the tree-towers. Silhouettes of tall, four-armed Vellara beings can be seen moving gracefully along the paths. The forest floor is far below, out of sight.

3. The Crystal Geysers (/assets/spots/geysers.jpg)
Prompt: A field of powerful thermal geysers erupting from a vibrant, mineral-rich tropical landscape. Columns of sparkling, crystal-clear water shoot hundreds of feet into the air. Because of the low gravity, the water arcs slowly and hangs in the air, refracting the light of the twin suns like diamonds before falling back in slow motion. Strange, colorful mineral formations surround the vents.

4. Sapphire Sands Beach (/assets/spots/beach.jpg)
Prompt: A wide beach scene on Tampa's coast. The sand is not beige but made of millions of crushed blue gemstones that glitter in the sunlight. A massive, towering ocean wave, perhaps 20 feet high, is cresting offshore, but it moves in surreal slow-motion due to the 0.6g gravity. Alien, palm-like trees with violet leaves line the shore. The ocean is a deep, vibrant cyan.

5. The Whispering Caverns (/assets/spots/caves.jpg)
Prompt: Inside a vast, subterranean cavern system. The space is filled with forests of tall, tube-like alien reeds (Sonic-Reeds) that glow with a faint, pulsing bioluminescence. The walls are rough, damp rock with strange mineral deposits. A small group of human explorers in futuristic gear with headlamps are walking through the alien reed forest, looking up in wonder.

6. Mount Aethel (/assets/spots/mountain.jpg)
Prompt: A view from the rugged summit of Mount Aethel, the highest peak on Tampa. The terrain is barren, jagged rock. The sky above is a deep, dark indigo, almost black, and stars are clearly visible even though the binary suns are just above the horizon, showing the thinness of the atmosphere. The tropical jungles and floating islands are a distant, hazy green map far below.

7. The Glass Desert (/assets/spots/desert.jpg)
Prompt: A surreal desert landscape where the sand has been fused into intricate, twisted glass sculptures by frequent lightning strikes. These glass formations come in all shapes and sizes, reflecting and refracting the light from the binary suns, creating a dazzling, almost blinding field of light. A large, stylized lightning storm cloud is visible in the distance.

8. Star-Fall Crater (/assets/spots/crater.jpg)
Prompt: An aerial photograph of a perfect, circular impact crater that has become a lush lake. The water in the lake glows with a vibrant, natural green bioluminescence from alien algae. The steep slopes of the crater rim are covered in dense, overgrown tropical jungle that spills down to the water's edge. It looks like a glowing green eye in the landscape.

9. The Razor Canyon (/assets/spots/canyon.jpg)
Prompt: A dramatic view looking down into a deep, incredibly narrow canyon. The sheer rock walls are jagged and sharp, plunging into shadow. Hardy, gnarled alien trees with strong roots cling precariously to the cliff sides. The perspective emphasizes the extreme depth and the rugged, unforgiving nature of the geology.

10. Nimbus Gardens (/assets/spots/clouds.jpg)
Prompt: A dreamlike scene of bio-engineered platforms floating amongst soft, thick, cotton-like clouds. The platforms are constructed from organic, woven materials and are covered in lush, flowering alien gardens and serene pools of water. They are connected by delicate bridges. The light is soft and diffused, creating a peaceful, heavenly atmosphere high above the planet's surface.
